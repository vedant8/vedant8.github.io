    <p>
      I work on large-scale data analysis in high-energy astrophysics, with a focus on particle detection and signal processing. My recent collaborations include work on [IceCube](https://icecube.wisc.edu/) and other detector-based experiments.

    <p>
      I develop tools to process raw sensor data, especially from Bayer-pattern sensors, to enable high-fidelity image reconstruction. Python, NumPy, and color science are my best friends.
