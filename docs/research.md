I work on large-scale data analysis and instrumentation development in high-energy astrophysics, with a focus on particle detection and signal processing. My recent collaborations include work on the [IceCube](https://icecube.wisc.edu/) Neutrino Observatory, at the South Pole, and the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS), at CERN, Geneva. I am particularly interested in measurements of the astrophysical neutrino spectrum, and what this tells us about cosmic ray accelerators from a multimessenger perspective.

      My current projects are largely focused on the development of hardware for the IceCube Upgrade, an expansion of the current IceCube detector to both improve sensitivity to GeV-scale neutrino oscillation measurements, and to better characterize the optical properties of the ice at the South Pole. I am leading the campaign to perform the optical calibration and modelling of South Pole ice using cameras incorporated into the ice.
