I work on large-scale data analysis and instrumentation development in high-energy astrophysics, with a focus on particle detection and signal processing. My recent collaborations include work on the [IceCube](https://icecube.wisc.edu/) Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole and the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) at CERN, Geneva. I am particularly interested in measurements of the astrophysical neutrino spectrum and what this tells us about cosmic ray accelerators from a multimessenger perspective.

## South Pole Ice Calibration
<div id="ice-calibration" data-aos="fade-up" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <p>
    I am currently focusing on the development of firmware for the IceCube Upgrade, an expansion of the current IceCube detector to both improve sensitivity to GeV-scale neutrino oscillation measurements, and to better characterize the optical properties of the ice at the South Pole. I am leading the campaign to perform the optical calibration and modelling of South Pole ice using cameras incorporated into the ice. This involves firmware development tasks, optical bench testing, and the commissioning of a 3D laser scanning system to analyze instrument response.

  <p>
    I have been a lead member of a team developing new optical detector prototypes for IceCube-Gen2, a high-energy expansion to the current IceCube detector, aiming to boost sensitivity to PeV-scale neutrinos, along with a great enhancement to the neutrino source detection sensitivity. I have contributed to modelling, design, testing, and firmware development for the Long Optical Module (LOM), a candidate for IceCube-Gen2. Twelve prototypes will be deployed during the upcoming 2025-26 IceCube Upgrade deployment season, as a field test.

## Astroparticle Physics with Cosmic Neutrinos

<div id="astroparticle" data-aos="fade-right" style="display: flex; gap: 2rem; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 3rem;">

  <div style="flex: 2 1 400px;">
    <p>
      My analyses focus on identifying astrophysical neutrino signals in IceCube data and constraining the energy spectrum and possible sources. I use machine learning and maximum likelihood estimation to study event directions, energies, and flavors.
